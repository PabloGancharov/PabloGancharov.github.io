### The Problem

Some days ago I bought a pair of Wii Classic controllers to play Mario Kart 64 on the Nintendo Virtual Console, but unfortunately I spent my money on a Chinese imitation, instead of buying the originals. 

> The main reason is that I don't wanted to wait 2 months for a package to arrive from US to Uruguay (where I live)
> 
> The secondary reason was the price, the pair of Chinese controllers cost then time less than the originals.

In fact, the controllers quality was awful, and one of it stopped to work after some use.

### The Solution
After google-ing a little I found this repo: [https://github.com/denizkoekden/arduino-wiimote](https://github.com/denizkoekden/arduino-wiimote) that was created 4 years ago, but updating it wasn't complicated.
